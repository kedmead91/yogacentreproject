A Project From  Studying  Cyber and Software Development at Tech Talent Academy

Task: The task was to create a webpage for a yoga centre with three types of yoga, 
on the webpage must be a timetable that uses javaScript to fill in times and dates of the classes and it had to include
the fully booked classes with a different colour.

Files for the project: 
main. js 
index.html
styles.css
images(for the webpage) 

Step 1: First I made the nav bar for my yoga centre website
Step 2: I Created the about the classes section.
Step 3: I created a table in HTML and CSS
Step 4: I sectioned my Javascript File into sections for selectors, eventlisteners and functions to make it more clear.
Step 4: I created the dates and times and classes in JavaScript
Step 5: I used JavaScript to change the background color and enter fully booked for classes that were fully booked.

Challenges: 
I had some challenges with my html and getting it to all fit together so it was clear for the user to see. 

How I solved it: I used W3 Schools and other documentation to study html and css further so I could understand furhter how to style the website and make
it all fit together to be clear for the user.
